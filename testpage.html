</ul>
<br>
This tutorial is meant to give you a jump start in using MySQL++. While
it is a very complicated and powerful library, it's possible to make
quite functional programs without tapping but a fraction of its power.
This section will introduce you to the most useful fraction.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">This tutorial assumes you know C++ fairly well, in particuler the Standard Template</span> Library (STL) and exceptions.<br>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li><big>3.1. Running the Examples</big></li>
</ul>
<br>
All of the examples are complete running programs. They may or may not
be built for you already, depending on how you installed the library.<br>
<br>
If you installed MySQL++ from the source tarball on a Unixy system, the
examples should have been built along with the library. If not, simply
go into the examples directory and type make.<br>
<br>
If you installed the library via RPM, the examples are in the
mysql++-devel RPM. After installing that, the examples are in
/usr/src/mysql++/examples. To build them, go into that directory and
type make -f Makefile.simple. See the file
/usr/share/doc/mysql++-devel*/README.examples for more details.<br>
<br>
If you are on a <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Windows system, the build process for the library should have built the examples as well. </span>Where
the programs are depends on which compiler you're using. There should
be a README.* file in the distribution specific to your compiler with
further instructions.<br>
<br>
Once you have the examples building, you need to initialize the sample
database by running the resetdb example. The usage of resetdb is as
follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resetdb [host [user [password [port]]]]<br>
<br>
If you leave off host, localhost is assumed. If you leave off user,
your current username is assumed. If you leave of the password, it is
assumed that you don't need one. And if you leave off the port, it will
use the standard MySQL port number.<br>
<br>
The user you give resetdb needs to be an account with permission to
create databases. Once the database is created you can use any account
that has full permission to the sample database mysql_cpp_data.<br>
<br>
You may also have to re-run resetdb after running some of the other examples, as they change the database.<br>
